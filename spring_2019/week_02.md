## Last Week's Accomplishments

 - Last week I primarly focused on trying to install AGENCY, with limited sucess. So far I've only been able to get Postgres up and running, however I'm currently running into trouble with creating the AGENCY server/users. Aside from that I've been reading up on Postgres and PHP syntax

 - Another thing that was done, though not by me, was that a subset of the AGENCY group were able to go to the Albany Public Library and were able to pinpoint which features we should focus on.

## This Week's Plan

- Next week, I hope to either finish installing AGENCY or at the very least get past my current block so that I can start actually contributing to the project

## Anything Blocking?

- Right now, the main thing blocking is the same thing blocking me last week (that being installing AGENCY)
