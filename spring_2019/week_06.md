## Last Week's Accomplishments

 - Last Week I taught myself more about PHP and how to use PHP and MySQl together. Using this I was able to create some code within the RCOS_APL app to give users an option to search for either a client's permenant bans, their active bans or all incidents that said client was a part off. I was then able to use MySql to generate and output those fields

## This Week's Plan

- Right now we have the SQL statements for more specialized searches, the problem is that we can't really test these features since our DB is empty (save for some dummy clients). So next thing to do is to simulate a standard scenario by filling in the DB

## Anything Blocking?

- As of right now, the DB we have has no data and thus we have no means of conducting good tests.
