## Last Week's Accomplishments

 - Last week, and during the break, I (alongside my group memebers) created the data model for the APL system as well as the database (from that data model) and created a rough website to test the database. 

   To create the data model and by extension the database we took various execl/.csv files and converted them to a rough data model using online material. We then modified said model based on what the APL people wanted

   We used MySql for the database and PHP (PHPstorm) for the website

## This Week's Plan

 - Now that we have a basic site up and running as well as a database. The first thing in our checklist is to create a way for people to search for a specific client name. From there users will be given an option via check box to see more specific details about a given user (ie what branch they are from, what incidents are they a part of etc) 

## Anything Blocking?

- As of right now, I don't have much experience with PHP, so I need to get up to speed with that language if I hope to contribute a lot to this project
