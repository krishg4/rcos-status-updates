## Last Week's Accomplishments

 - Last week, we formed three sepearte groups, one group to handle the AGENCY software installation, one group to revamp the front end of the website, and the last group to work on creating a new software based on the AGENCY software. I am part of the third group and thus tasked on working on creating a data model to reflect the database system.

## This Week's Plan

- Now that the goups have bee established and work given out, I plan on working on creating the rought/final draft of the data model and if time still permits work on actually creating the database based on our finished data model

## Anything Blocking?

- Nothing blocking at the moment.
