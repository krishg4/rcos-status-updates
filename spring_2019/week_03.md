## Last Week's Accomplishments

 - Last week we tried once again to install AGENCY, but the furthest any of us has gotten was getting the Postgres sever. Unfortunately we got stuck on trying to get PHP to work alongside.


## This Week's Plan

- We decided to take a step back and gather our bearings, so as of writing this we plan to get us up to speed with PHP and Postgres and possibly choosing between either extending AGENCY (if we can get it installed) or just straight up create a whole new program for the library

## Anything Blocking?

- Right now, the main thing blocking is the same thing blocking me last week (that being installing AGENCY)
