## Last Week's Accomplishments

Worked on large group presentation, also read up more about django's internal
authentication system as well as ways to use external ways (though I couldn't
find a way for django to use its authentication system in tandem with RPI's login
system)

## This Week's Plan

I hope to at leat the very least find a way to get django's internal system to use
RPI's login site, hopefully with the mentors help if need be.

## Anything Blocking?

All I'm having problem is that I don't really know how to get Django to utilize an external
site to login users instead of using Django's internal system
