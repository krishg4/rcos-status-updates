## Last Week's Accomplishments

Focused on preparing for my part in the large group presentation. Aside from
that I read a bit more about django's use of the REMOTE_USER "class" and how to potentially extend it to instead of using an external database use an external website

That being said the main problem that still plagues me is the fact that there isn't a concrete guide on using djano in conjencture with an external site. As far as I'm concerned all I found is a video where it gets showed off but thats about it

## This Week's Plan

Due to Thanksgiving as well as a test I don't see myself being able to do much, however I hope to primarily talk with my mentor and see if she knows anyone who has worked with django and in particular used django as well as an external login site

## Anything Blocking?

Still having the same problem as before, I can't seem to figure out the general idea of using an exernal site with django, once I get that general idea I'm confident I'd be able to finish this issue easily.
