## Last Week's Accomplishments

Was able to integrate the cas server (I think) using django_cas_ng and mama_cas using the below links as a means of
guidance. In short I used mama_cas as a means of allowing users to, when they sign out, they stay signed out no matter what. As for django_cas_ng, as far as I was to understand django_cas_ng is the main class that django uses in order to incoporate the CAS system that most sites use as an authnetication backend for login. The main site that the CAS system uses for check for authentication of course being the RPI login site. As far as I'm aware I think that I was able to get the overall system to work, I just need to get the petitions site to use the framework to login users and I should be done with my part.

## This Week's Plan

Seeing that finals are coming up, I'm not sure I might be able to finish, if I can then the plan is to finish the
login system. But if not at the very least commit all my code.
