## Last Week's Accomplishments

Still working on trying to connect Django with RPI's CAS system with no luck as I'm stuck with trying to find a way to have django's internal authentication to use an external source rather than the traditional create a user and login from there

## This Week's Plan

Read up on ways to potentially use an external site with django's internal authnetication system, or if possible just create an external authentication system based on RPI's login system

## Anything Blocking?

My main issue right now is trying to understand how the RPI CAS is coded
