## Last Week's Accomplishments

Didn't do much during Thanksgiving break, just enjoyed the break. But the week before I read through the documentation for django in particular the REMOTE_USER as well as the PersistentRemoteUserMiddleware documentation for a means to understand how to get Django to use external sites instead of external databases. I also read through the CAS API that RPI uses for something that could potentially help me, as well as other RPI sites that use CAS for their login site.

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/howto/auth-remote-user/
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/middleware/#django.contrib.auth.middleware.PersistentRemoteUserMiddleware
(These were the main sites that I used to learn more about Django's external authentication system)

## This Week's Plan

Next week I hope with the help of Grace to find a more concrete example of using Django and an external site so that I get a better view of the problem as right now I'm just grasping at straws.

## Anything Blocking?

Still having the same problem as before, I can't seem to figure out the general idea of using an exernal site with django, once I get that general idea I'm confident I'd be able to finish this issue easily.
